# Eco-Cost Calculator

A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool: build a product once on the Home tab and
every other tab — Carbon footprint, Water consumption, Energy used in
production, Recycled content, Sensitivity analysis — computes its indicator
from that same product automatically. Nothing needs to be re-entered per tab.

Home uses the single-indicator eco-costs method (in euros) as its primary
metric: build a product from parts (material + weight), optional processing
and end-of-life treatment per part, assembly energy, transport, and any custom
line item (which can carry its own eco-cost, carbon, water, and energy values).
Two "Load example" presets (felt-tip pen, pencil body) are included as
quick-start templates. Materials are picked via a searchable combobox (type to
filter) rather than one long dropdown.

## Tabs

- **Home** — the product builder, plus an overview dashboard totalling every
  indicator at once, the eco-cost breakdown/hotspot chart, and multi-indicator
  scenario comparison.
- **Carbon footprint** — kg CO2e breakdown and hotspot chart for the product
  you built on Home.
- **Water consumption** — litres breakdown and hotspot chart, same product.
- **Energy used in production** — kWh (embodied/cumulative energy demand)
  breakdown and hotspot chart, same product.
- **Recycled content** — weight-weighted % recycled content across the parts
  you built, with a radial meter and a list of any higher-recycled material
  alternatives available in the reference data.
- **Sensitivity analysis** — pick one input from the product you built (a
  part's weight, the assembly energy amount, a transport leg, a custom line),
  vary it by ±10/20/50%, and see how every indicator responds.

Carbon, Water, and Energy also show a "best case / worst case" range meter:
holding materials/transport/end-of-life fixed, how far would the total move if
assembly energy alone used the cleanest vs. dirtiest source already in the
reference data. Every breakdown table has a CSV export button, and the Home
overview card has a "Print / save as PDF" button that opens a dedicated report
layout via the browser's native print dialog.

## Running it

No build step, no server-side logic — it's a static site.

```
python -m http.server 8000
```

then open `http://localhost:8000/`. (Or just open `index.html` directly in a browser.)

## Files

- `index.html` — page structure
- `styles.css` — styling
- `data.js` — the eco-cost reference database (materials, processes, energy,
  transport, end-of-life) and the two preset examples, with sourcing notes
- `app.js` — calculator logic, rendering, and scenario persistence (localStorage)

## About the data

The eco-cost figures in `data.js` are based on Idematapp / ecocostsvalue.com
reference data (2020 excerpts), covering common materials, processes, energy, and
transport modes. Use the "Custom line item" field in the calculator for any
material, process, or cost not covered.

The carbon (kg CO2e), water (L), energy-in-production (kWh), and recycled-content
(%) figures are a **separate** data set: representative values compiled from
general public LCA literature, not from the same certified source as the eco-cost
figures. Treat them as indicative reference values rather than certified numbers,
and use the custom line fields for measured/certified data where precision
matters.

The two preset examples are checked against their known eco-cost reference totals
to a few cents (source figures are pre-rounded to 2 decimals, so a full-precision
recomputation won't hit the exact cent — the calculator shows this comparison
openly rather than silently matching or hiding it). The carbon/water/energy/
recycled figures for the presets are not separately validated against a reference
total.
